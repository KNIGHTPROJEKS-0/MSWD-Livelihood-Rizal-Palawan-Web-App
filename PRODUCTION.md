## üîê Production Security

### Authentication & Authorization
```bash
# Production JWT configuration
SECRET_KEY=<256-bit-secret-key>
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# Role-based access control
SUPERADMIN_ROLES=["superadmin"]
ADMIN_ROLES=["admin", "mswd_staff"]
USER_ROLES=["beneficiary"]
```

### Security Headers
```python
# Production security middleware
SECURITY_HEADERS = {
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
    "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
    "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'",
    "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
}
```

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **PII Handling**: Personal data anonymized in logs
- **Audit Logging**: All user actions logged with timestamps

- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# API health endpoints
GET /health                 # Basic health status
GET /health/detailed        # Comprehensive health check
GET /health/db             # Database connectivity
GET /health/redis          # Cache connectivity
GET /health/firebase       # Firebase services
```

### Key Metrics
```bash
# Application metrics
- API response time (target: <500ms)
- Error rate (target: <1%)
- Throughput (requests/second)
- Active users (concurrent)
- Database connections
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization

# Business metrics
- Application submissions/day
- User registrations/day
- Program enrollments/day
- Document uploads/day
- Notification delivery rate
```

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
# Critical alerts (immediate response)
- API down (>5 minutes)
- Database connection failure
- High error rate (>5% for 5 minutes)
- Memory usage >90%
- Disk space <10%

# Warning alerts (monitor closely)
- Response time >1s (sustained)
- Error rate >2%
- Memory usage >80%
- Database slow queries
- Failed backup jobs
```

### Log Management
```bash
# Log levels in production
ERROR: System errors, exceptions
WARN: Performance issues, deprecated features
INFO: User actions, system events
DEBUG: Disabled in production

# Log retention
- Application logs: 30 days
- Audit logs: 7 years (compliance)
- Access logs: 90 days
- Error logs: 1 year
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

### Production Database Configuration
```sql
-- Performance optimization
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
max_connections = 100
shared_buffers = 256MB
effective_cache_size = 1GB
work_mem = 4MB
maintenance_work_mem = 64MB

-- Monitoring
log_statement = 'all'
log_duration = on
log_min_duration_statement = 1000
```

### Backup Strategy
```bash
# Automated backups (Railway managed)
- Full backup: Daily at 2 AM UTC
- Point-in-time recovery: 7 days
- Backup retention: 30 days
- Cross-region replication: Enabled

# Manual backup procedures
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Backup verification
pg_restore --list backup_file.sql
```

### Database Maintenance
```sql
-- Weekly maintenance tasks
VACUUM ANALYZE;
REINDEX DATABASE mswd_production;

-- Monitor table sizes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables 
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls, total_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### API Performance
```python
# Production optimizations
- Connection pooling (max 20 connections)
- Query optimization with indexes
- Response caching (Redis)
- Async request handling
- Request rate limiting
- Response compression (gzip)
```

### Frontend Performance
```javascript
// Production build optimizations
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Bundle size optimization
- Image optimization (WebP)
- CDN for static assets
- Service worker caching
- Tree shaking
```

### Database Performance
```sql
-- Critical indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_applications_status ON applications(status);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_applications_created_at ON applications(created_at);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_programs_active ON programs(is_active);

-- Query optimization
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM applications WHERE status = 'pending';
```
